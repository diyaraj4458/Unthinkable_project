*# AI Customer Support Bot

## Overview
This project simulates an AI-powered customer support bot that handles frequently asked questions (FAQs), maintains conversational context, and escalates queries that can't be resolved automatically. Built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and OpenAI's LLM, it's a great example of integrating AI for real-world applications.

*Key Features:*
- Answers user queries based on a customizable FAQs dataset.
- Retains conversation history for contextual responses.
- Simulates escalation for unresolved queries.
- Includes a simple web-based chat interface for easy testing.

This repo contains the full codebase, as developed with guidance from AI assistant resources. *Feel free to fork and improve it!*
